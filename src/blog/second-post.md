# How I Built My Portfolio Blog with React and Markdown

In this post, I’ll walk you through the process of adding a blog to my portfolio using React, Markdown files, and some handy libraries like `react-markdown` and `gray-matter`.

## Why Markdown?
Markdown is easy to write, version, and manage. It keeps content separate from code and is perfect for developers.

## The Stack
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- react-markdown
- gray-matter

## What’s Next?
I plan to add more features like tags, search, and comments. Stay tuned!
